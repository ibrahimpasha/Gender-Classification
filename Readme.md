## Gender Classification:
Gender classification is one of the most interesting and challenging problems in many commercial domains. Existing systems mainly use features such as standard word, n-gram and POS (part of speech) for classification. And, Feature selection using filter methods such as Chi squared test, Information gain and Correlation coefficient scores, Wrapper methods such as Recursive feature elimination algorithm and Embedded methods such as regularization methods. In this paper, I propose feature selection from a model based on feature importance after a certain threshold parameter. Empirical evaluation using a real-life blog data set shows that this technique improves the classification accuracy of the current state of the art methods significantly.

### Libraries needed:
Run the following commands to install necessary libraries.

```pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install yellowbrick
```

### Steps to run the program:
There are two ways to run the program. I suggest you to go with method 1 since the code is notebook readable format

1. If you want to run on Jupyter Notebook, open the file ```Gender Classification.ipynb``` on JupyterNotebook restart the kernel and run from starting cell.
You can run all the cells at a time.

2. If you want to run the python file open the command prompt and run the following command

```python GenderClassification.py```

1. Intel I5 7th gen processor.
2. 12GB RAM
3. Size of the project: 752 MB
